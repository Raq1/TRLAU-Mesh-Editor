In comparision to the Noesis plugin I previously made 3 years ago, this Blender addon is full of brand new features, available thanks to a deeper understanding of the format and thanks to Blender's API which allows to import much more metadata than Noesis allows.

# The development of this addon heavily relied on code created by ChatGPT. Research collaborators were not directly involved in the code.

## Features include

- Tomb Raider Legend, Legend Next Gen, Anniversary, Underworld Models Import
- Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary Models Export
- Animation import/export
- HInfo import/export such as HBox, HSphere, HMarkers and HCapsules
- HInfo live editing such as position, rotation and scale (where applicable) and export
- Export is no longer limited to character models only/will no longer cause issues on scene objects/props/vehicles and such
- Vertex color import/export
- Environment Mapping and Eye Reflection Environment Mapping import/export, to create meshes with reflection
- File size of exported models is now significantly reduced thanks to a more optimized way of storing weights
- Material and texture import, including live editing Blending mode
- Target and Markup import/ Target export
- Adding HInfo Components to bones
- PCD > Image, Image > PCD conversion
- RAW > Image, Image > RAW conversion

The addon also allows to snap an Armature's first bone's position and rotation directly to an HMarker. This allows live editing of things like weapon attachment. No more blindly changing float values to achieve the result you want.

The addon is currently capable of importing cloth physics data, however nothing is done with that during export. Cloth physics data still has to be properly implemented into the addon. In the future, it will be possible to export cloth data and create new physics bones.

## What's planned

- Write vertices from face corners instead of actual vertex data. This will greatly improve export times and fix issues such as UV bleeding when exporting a model with no extra vertices from UV seams
- Write Markups
- Cloth export
- Level Import/Export
- Better handling of MFace data
- Addition of quality of fixes such as adding a warning for exceeding 10,922 face limit on a mesh, ignoring loose vertices on export, fixing "list index out of range" when trying to import an exported mesh

## Known limits

- 2 weights per vertex for skinning
- 10922 faces per material
- The limit of vertex count for one entire model is 21,845
- If any material has the "Flat Shading" flag enabled, the count of Virtual Segments (bone weighting entries) is limited to 153 which means your skinning will be optimized to accomodate this
